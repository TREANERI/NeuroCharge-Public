# NeuroCharge & Rezen8: Bridging the Neuro-Care Gap 🧠🚀

This repository serves as the public overview for the NeuroCharge ecosystem, a dual-track approach to solving the global neuro-care crisis.

## 🔬 The Pivot: Data-Driven Clinical Support
We have transitioned from passive delivery concepts to active biometric diagnostics. By focusing on **HRV (Heart Rate Variability)** and **EDA (Electrodermal Activity)**, we provide clinicians with objective biomarkers to accelerate ADHD and Autism assessments.

## 🛡️ Our Dual-Track Solution
1. **NeuroCharge (Medical Device):** An AI platform for Clinical Decision Support. It helps clinicians differentiate between sensory overload and executive dysfunction to reduce the UK's assessment backlog.
2. **Rezen8 (Wellness Wearable):** A proactive 'comfort blanket' using 30–150 Hz Vagus Nerve stimulation. It uses real-time biofeedback to pull users out of a 'freeze' state before executive function fails.



## 🌍 The Mission
* **The Gap:** We are addressing the needs of the **500 million people** globally caught in the care gap.
* **UK Impact:** Supporting the **2.5 million undiagnosed adults** in the UK to reduce the annual **£6.5B–£11.2B** economic strain.
* **Status:** Proudly supported by the **NHS Innovation Service**.

## 🤝 Join the Founding Team
We are headhunting a **Founding Hardware Lead** (Biometric sensors/EDA/HRV) and an **Ops Partner**. If you want to turn lived neurodivergent experience into life-changing technology, let's chat.
